# Slackvoice

A simple app written in node.js (and, marginally designed to run on Heroku) to play sound effects on different webhook triggers to any other machine running the same webpage.

### Tech

* [Express.js]
* [Socket.io] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Slack API] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

```sh
$ SLACK_URL=your Slack incoming webhook url
$ node server.js
```

Open in browser with:
http://localhost:8080
