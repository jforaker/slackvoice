A simple app written in node.js (and, marginally designed to run on Heroku) to play sound effects on different webhook triggers to any other machine running the same webpage.

Some built-in functions:
* Stripe Webhook for charge.succeeded & charge.failed sound effects
* Input any public URL to a sound effect
* Sound effects: Choo Choo, Failed, Cash Register, and Crash
* Hook up to Heroku for automatic refreshes
* Hook up to CircleCi to let the team know when a new deploy happens
* Speak any text using the Google Translate API

For extra fun, hook it up to a Raspberry Pi and add Slash Commands in your Slack so that you can do things like:
* /speak Hello World
* /sound denied
* /volume 0.5
