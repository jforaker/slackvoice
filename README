A simple app written in node.js (and, marginally designed to run on Heroku) to play sound effects on different webhook triggers to any other machine running the same webpage.

Technology:
Express.js
Socket.io
Slack API

Some built-in functions:
* Sound effects: Choo Choo, Failed, Cash Register, and Crash
* Speak any text using the Google Translate API

Slash Commands in your Slack so that you can do things like:
* /sound speak Hello World
* /sound money

For info on setting up on heroku, see this tutorial:
http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js

Install dependencies with:
npm install .

Run with:
node server.js

Open in browser with:
http://localhost:8080

Add your stripe incoming webhook key to your env:
heroku config:add SLACK_URL=<your url>
